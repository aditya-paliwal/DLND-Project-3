# Project Title

Using Recurrent Neural Network for Generation of TV Scripts

## Introduction

This was my third project in Udacity 17-week Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation. In this project, I built a [Recurrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNN) using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and used it to generate a new [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern) using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons. The project was written in Python (on a [_Jupyter Notebook_](https://github.com/HaraldoFilho/DLND-tv-script-generation/blob/master/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb)) using the libraries _numpy_ and _tensorflow_, running on an _Anaconda_ environment

The components necessary to build a Recurrent Neural Network are implemented using the following functions:
- get_inputs
- get_init_cell
- get_embed
- build_rnn
- build_nn
- get_batches

Complete implementation of all these functions, mentioned above, can be seen in the notebook file (project+3+code.ipynb)


### Topics Covered
