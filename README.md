# Project Title

Image Classification

## Introduction

In this project we had to build a [Recurrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNN) using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and use it to generate a new [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern) using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons. The project was written in Python (on a [_Jupyter Notebook_](https://github.com/HaraldoFilho/DLND-tv-script-generation/blob/master/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb)) using the libraries _numpy_ and _tensorflow_, running on an _Anaconda_ environment
